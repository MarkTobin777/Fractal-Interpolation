The name of the repository may be a bit misleading, as it includes code that implements the deterministic algorithm for fractal generation in Processing, as well as the random iteration algorithm in Python.
The deterministic algorithm is used for fractal interpolation in a simple example ("simple_IFS.pde") in Processing. Then the random iteration algorithm is used to interpolate data in Python.
